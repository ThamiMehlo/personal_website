				<i>Student Software Engineer at WeThinkCode</i><br><br>
					
					I completed highschool in 2010 and went on to do my tertiary studies at the <a href="https://www.uct.ac.za">University of Cape Town</a>, where I completed my undergraduate Bachelor of Commerce degree in Economics (with Finance).<br>
					Upon completion of my tertiary studies, I was employed by the TFG Head Office as a store planner. It was there where I was first exposed to coding...<br>

					<br>Although my job description did not involve coding or developing of any kind, I often found myself coding.<br>
					At the time, I was coding in VBA excel so much so that I had built a pretty amazing business tool with about 13 end-users which, for someone with no prior coding background and a few youtube videos and some websites to rely on, was a pretty big deal for me.<br>
					What was abundantly clear to me is that I needed to be in a space where I could essentially invest myself in what is seemingly my obsession.<br><br>
					With that came the decision to quit my job in pursuit of my "upgrading" my skill set and now I am a full-time student software engineer.<br>
					During the 8 months after quitting my job and before beginning at WeThinkCode_, through online resources, I managed to learn a few programming languages.<br>Namely, Python, C and the front-end web development tools (HTML, CSS and JavaScript) as well SQL (although it is not really considered a programming language).<br>
